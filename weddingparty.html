Cayla Thompson

<p>
(Maid of Honor)
</p>

Carly is fortunate enough to have an amazing sister, Cayla. The two of them have been inseparable since Carly began sharing her parents at age 3. She even shares a birthday with her (Carly’s is Dec. 21st and Cayla’s is Dec. 20th)! But more importantly, they share a love of French Nouvelle Vauge cinema and French macarons- it’s only fitting that Cayla will be Maid of Honor at her sister’s wedding at Maison May this September.... 
C'est le temps de l'amour, 
Le temps des copains et de l'aventure!

(Best Man)

Tristan and Mark first became friends riding on Tenafly Volunteer Ambulance Corps. They both volunteered countless hours and usually ended up riding on the same emergency calls and hanging out together as they tried to entertain ourselves in the downtime. The two bonded outside of the corps when they both shared exploring the local area around them and would drive for many hours into the night while talking about life, the universe and everything. Even when Mark and Tristan went off to different colleges, they would visit each other regularly at school or meet up back in New Jersey to enjoy a late night cruise to White Castle, or hit up a local 24 hour diner.

      <p> About Us </p>
      
        <p>

          Carly and Tristan met in Dallas in the summer of 2013. It was Tristan’s first summer out of college and he had just accepted a job in Southlake, Texas, a mere 1,600 miles from his hometown in New Jersey. Carly, a Texas native, was working in Dallas and decided to give the dating app Tinder a try based on the recommendation of her friend, Tommy. She had just visited Tommy in NYC and when she saw Tristan’s profile on the app- a Columbia Graduate and NYC transplant- she was intrigued! Why would someone move from The Big Apple to the Big D?
