<p>
(Maid of Honor)
</p>

This is Cayla, she is my little sister, (even though she has always been much taller than me). We have been by each others side since she was born. We have helped each other through hard times and shared many good times together. I can't wait to spend my wedding day with her by my side. I could not image my special day without her love and support.
