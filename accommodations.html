      <p> About Us </p>
      
        <p>

          Carly and Tristan met in Dallas in the summer of 2013. It was Tristan’s first summer out of college and he had just accepted a job in Southlake, Texas, a mere 1,600 miles from his hometown in New Jersey. Carly, a Texas native, was working in Dallas and decided to give the dating app Tinder a try based on the recommendation of her friend, Tommy. She had just visited Tommy in NYC and when she saw Tristan’s profile on the app- a Columbia Graduate and NYC transplant- she was intrigued! Why would someone move from The Big Apple to the Big D?
